The substring() method extracts characters from start to end (exclusive).
The substring() method does not change the original string.

If start is greater than end, arguments are swapped: (4, 1) = (1, 4).
Start or end values less than 0, are treated as 0.

## JavaScript String method toLowerCase()

## JavaScript String method indexOf()
The indexOf() method returns the position of the first occurrence of a value in a string.
The indexOf() method returns -1 if the value is not found.
The indexOf() method is case sensitive
# JavaScript Number methods
### JavaScript Number methods Math.round(),ceil(),floor()
The ceil() method rounds a decimal number up to the next largest integer and returns it.
### JavaScript Number methods Math.max() and Math.min()
The max() method finds the maximum value among the specified values and returns it.
The min() method finds the minimum value among the specified values and returns it
### JavaScript Number methods Math.pow() and Math.sqrt()
The pow() method computes the power of a number by raising the second argument
to the power of the first argument.
The sqrt() method computes the square root of a specified number and returns it
### JavaScript String method Math.abs() and Math.random()
The abs() method finds the absolute value of the specified number (without any sign) and returns it.
The Math.random() function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number between 0 (inclusive)
and 1 (exclusive).
## JavaScript Number method isNaN()
The isNaN() function checks if a value is NaN (Not-a-Number) or not


# what is array in javascript

An array is an object that holds values (of any type) not particularly in named properties/keys,
but rather in numerically indexed position
In JavaScript, an array is an ordered list of values. Each value is called an element specified by
an index. ... First, an array can hold values of mixed types.
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:

## array methods



```bash
let array=["tamim","safi","sahvaat",1,true,{}]
array[3]=2

console.log(array)

// easy way to show array in code 
```
